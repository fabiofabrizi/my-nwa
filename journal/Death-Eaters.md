**The Arrival**

"Listen to me, reliving family history . . ." he said quietly, "why, I am growing quite sentimental. . . . But look, Harry!  My true family returns. . . ." 
The air was suddenly full of the swishing of cloaks.  Between graves, behind the yew tree, in every shadowy space, wizards were Apparating.  All of them were hooded and masked.  And one by one they moved forward . . . slowly, cautiously, as though they could hardly believe their eyes Voldemort stood in silence, waiting for them.  Then one of the Death Eaters fell to his knees, crawled toward Voldemort and kissed the hem of his black robes. 


**"Master . . . Master"**

he murmured. 
The Death Eaters behind him did the same; each of them approaching Voldemort on his knees and kissing his robes, before backing away and standing up, forming a silent circle, which enclosed Tom Riddle s grave, Harry, Voldemort, and the sobbing and twitching heap that was Wormtail.  Yet they left gaps in the circle, as though waiting for more people.  Voldemort, however, did not seem to expect more.  He looked around at the hooded faces, and though there was no wind rustling seemed to run around the circle, as though it had shivered.


**"Welcome, Death Eaters,"** 

said Voldemort quietly. "Thirteen years. . . thirteen years since last we met.  Yet you answer my call as though it were yesterday, we are still united under the Dark Mark, then!  Or are we?" 
He put back his terrible face and sniffed, his slit-like nostrils widening. 
"I smell guilt," he said.  "There is a stench or guilt upon the air. 
A second shiver ran around the circle, as though each member of it longed, but did not dare to step back from him. 
"I see you all, whole and healthy, with your powers intact - such prompt appearances! and I ask myself . . . why did this band of wizards never come to the aid of their master, to whom they swore eternal loyalty?" 
No one spoke.  No one moved except Wormtail, who was upon the ground, still sobbing over his bleeding arm. 
"And I answer myself," whispered Voldemort, "they must have believed me broken, they thought I was gone.  They slipped back among my enemies, and they pleaded innocence, and ignorance, and bewitchment. . . .
