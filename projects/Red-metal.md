This is **red metal**.

This is lorem ipsum text from **Harry Potter**.

The smallest of frowns creased Bagman's smooth face. "No, I haven't," he said. "I - well, like I say, I've taken a liking to you. Just thought I'd offer ..." "Well, thanks," said Harry, "but I think I'm nearly there with the egg . . . couple more days should crack it." He wasn't entirely sure why he was refusing Bagman's help, except that Bagman was almost a stranger to him, and accepting his assistance would feel somehow much more like cheating than asking advice from Ron, Hermione, or Sirius. Bagman looked almost affronted, but couldn't say much more as Fred and George turned up at that point. "Hello, Mr. Bagman," said Fred brightly. "**Can we buy you a drink?**" "Er . . . no," said Bagman, with a last disappointed glance at Harry, "**no, thank you, boys ...**"
