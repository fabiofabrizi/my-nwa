This is the **witche's eye**. The eye is **broken**.

This is lorem ipsum text from **Harry Potter**.
"**Another old friend**," growled Moody. "I've been looking forward to a chat with old Snape. . . . Come on, you. . ." 
And he seized Malfoy's upper arm and marched him off toward the dungeons. 
Professor McGonagall stared anxiously after them for a few moments, then waved her wand at her fallen books, causing them to soar up into the air and back into her arms. 
"Don't talk to me," Ron said quietly to Harry and Hermione as they sat down at the Gryffindor table a few minutes later, surrounded by excited talk on all sides about what had just happened. 
"Why not?" said Hermione in surprise. 
"Because I want to fix that in my memory forever," said Ron, his eyes closed and an uplifted expression on his face. "Draco Malfoy, the amazing bouncing ferret." 
Harry and Hermione both laughed, and Hermione began doling beef casserole onto each of their plates. 
"He could have really hurt Malfoy, though," she said. "It was good, really, that Professor McGonagall stopped it -" 
"Hermione!" said Ron furiously, his eyes snapping open again, "you're ruining the best moment of my life!" 
Hermione made an impatient noise and began to eat at top speed again. 
"Don't tell me you're going back to the library this evening?" said Harry, watching her. 
"Got to," said Hermione thickly. "Loads to do."
